# Example of papermerge.conf.py
#
#  papermerge.conf.py - is a configuration files with python syntax
#
# Copy this file to /etc/papermerge.conf.py or to your project's root directory 
# and modify it to suit your needs.
# As this file contains passwords it should only be readable by the user

# OCR
#######

# Customize the default language that tesseract will attempt to use when
# parsing documents.  It should be a 3-letter language code consistent with ISO
# 639: https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php

# eng = for English
# deu = for German
# spa = for Spanish

# Internationalization & Localization
######################################

# Internationalization = i18n

# In what language is user interface.
# At this point there two options:
# 
#  en, en-US, en-UK, ... = for user interface in English language
#  de, de-DE, de-AT, ... = for user interface in German language
#
#  English is default fallback i.e. if you don't specify anything,
#  of specify unsupported language - English will be used.

# LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'

# If is set to True, will use same language code as your Web Browser (agent) does.
# Browsers send 'Accept-Language' header with their locale.
# For more, read: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language
# If set to True  - will override LANGUAGE_CODE option
# If set to False - language code specified in LANGUAGE_CODE option will be used.

# Binary Dependencies
###########################
#
# Papermerge uses a number of open source 3rd parties for various purposes.
# One of the most obvious example is tesseract - used to OCR documents (extract
# text from binary image file). Another, less obvious example is pdfinfo
# utility provided by poppler-utils package: pdfinfo is used to count number of
# pages in pdf document.
# 
# Settings prefixed with BINARY_ are used to configure paths to those dependencies.
# Here is the full list of all binary dependencies and their default values.

# file utility used to find out mime type of a file

# BINARY_FILE = "/usr/bin/file"

# Provided by ImageMagick package.
# convert is used for resizing images.

# BINARY_CONVERT = "/usr/bin/convert"

# Provided by Poppler Utils.
# pdftoppm used to extract images from PDF file.

# BINARY_PDFTOPPM = "/usr/bin/pdftoppm"

# Provided by Poppler Utils.
# pdfinfo is used to get page count in PDF file

# BINARY_PDFINFO = "/usr/bin/pdfinfo"

# Provided by ImageMagick package.
# identity is used to get number of pages in TIFF file.

# BINARY_IDENTIFY = "/usr/bin/identify"

# Provided by tesseract package.
# tesseract is used to extract text from images/PDF files.

# BINARY_OCR = "/usr/bin/tesseract"

# Provided by pdftk package
# pdftok is used to reorder, cut/paste, delete pages withing PDF document

# BINARY_PDFTK = "/usr/bin/pdftk"
