# We :heart: Your Contributions

Thank you for taking your time to contribute to Papermerge. This guide will
help you spend your time well, and help us keep Papermerge focused and making
valuable progress.

in general, for very small changes like fixing documentation typo, remove
unused variable or just remove a redundant white space - just create a pull
request and very likely that your change (if it is reasonable) will be
accepted immediately.

For more **significant changes**, for example you plan to add a feature, or
change/add a whole paragraph to the documentation - please **first discuss the
change** you wish to make via GitHub issue, pull request or
[email](mailto:eugen@papermerge.com).


## Fix a Typo

Contribute to the project just by fixing documentation's typos. Like tis one. English is not [project maintainer's](https://github.com/ciur/) native lnguage so he makes lots of typoz.

Fixing documentation typos is easiest and fastest way to value to the project. 

## Open an Issue.

Another way to contribute is open issues. Obviously this means you need to at
least run once application and test it.


## Translate

Currently Papermerge's user interface is available in English and German.
However, if your master another language (e.g French, Spanish, Russian etc)
you can add great value to the project by translating it to your own native
language. Because Papermerge is based on absolutely awesome [Django Web
Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) all Django's documentation applies
here as well. So it is a good idea to first go through [Django's i18n
documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/i18n/) and then
come back to translation Papermerge specific topics. For detailed information
check [Translators Guide in
documentation](https://papermerge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/translators_guide/index.html).
