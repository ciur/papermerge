Organizing your documents in folders may serve you well for the beginning. However as
number of folders grow it starts to be very challenging to keep organized. 

Folders have one huge disadvantage: it is very
easy to forget which document belongs to which folder.

Tags comes to the rescue. For example if you have car insurance document just

forgot where you placed your insurance documents just search for documents
with "insurance" and/or "car" tags.
