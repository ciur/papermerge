Access and Permissions
=======================

Papermerge features per Folder/per Documents access management.

   Access management for selected folder.


In order to understand important concepts behind access and permissions let's
consider first very simple scenario of two users - admin and margaret (this
are usernames, this is why they are written in lowercase).

Admin - is very first user of the system which automatically makes him superuser.
A superuser is the one who can add other users to the system. So, admin created margaret
user.
In general superuser can do almost anything - add other users, remove other users, access API tokens
and so on. However one very important question arises: *if superuser (admin) can do
everything in the system - does it means that he, the admin, has access to all
folders and documents in the system?*. Answer is - *no*.

.. important::

    Every user (including admin) in Papermerge System has his own space of folders and documents.
    Once a user uploaded a document - he/she is considered the owner of that document.
    Initially **only the owner has full access to the document**. And **only the owner can decide** who will
    have what access and permissions to his/her documents and folders.


Thus, if margaret created a folder titled mar-folder, by default - admin user won't be able to see neither mar- folder nor the content of it.

   Folders created (and documents uploaded) by margaret user, by default are visible accessible
   only by her.

On the other hand, if admin creates a folder titled for-margaret, and adds
read only access permission for margaret (click on folder for-margaret,
access, create, ...):

.. figure:: img/access/03-read-only-for-margaret.png

   Assign read only access for margaret

Then, margaret will be able to see (view, read only mode) folder for-margaret (owned by admin).
Read only documents and folders are marked with big red lock.
This situation is illustrated in figure below.

.. figure:: img/access/04-read-only-access-for-margaret.png

   Margaret has read only access on folder owned by admin user.


.. note::

   If a document is in read only mode for margaret, then margaret won't be able to change metadata
   associated with the document. Similarly - margaret won't be able to delete or change order of pages
   within respective document.
