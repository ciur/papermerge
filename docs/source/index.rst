Papermerge DMS
===============

I have nothing against paper. Paper is a brilliant invention of humanity. But in the
21st century I find it more appropriate for paper-based documents to be
digitized (scanned). Once scanned, appropriate software can be used to find any
document in a fraction of a second, just by typing a few keywords.


Papermerge is a document management system designed to work with scanned
documents. As well as OCR with full text search, it provides the look and feel of
major modern file browsers, with a hierarchical structure for files and folders,
so that you can organize your documents in a similar way to Dropbox (via web)
or Google Drive.

What It Does
============

 * It OCRs your documents
 * Provides you nice user interface to easly browse your documents
 * Augments your documents with :doc:`metadata`
 * Helps you instantly find your documents:
    
    * based on extracted text
    * based on :doc:`metadata`

 * Helps you fix scanned documents issues


What It Does't Do
=================
 
 * It does **not** take control of your documents. Documents are **stored on filesystem** in a simple and intuitive manner so that you can take snapshot of your data at any time.
 * It does **not** stay in your way when you make decisions about your data.
