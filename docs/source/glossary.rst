OCR
~~~~

Abbreviation from **optical character recognition**. OCR is the process of
extracting plain text (and associated information) from an image, photo or a
picture. Example: John takes a photo with his mobile phone of a paper based
bank statement. Let's say IBAN number appears on that document. From
resulted photo - filename *bank-statement.jpeg* - John won't be able to copy IBAN number and pass it over whatsapp to his wife.

On the other hand, if the same bank statement photo is processed using optical
character recognition technology (OCR) - the text is extracted from the photo
(for example as bank-statement.txt file) and John can open bank-statement.txt
file, select IBAN number and copy/paste it in whatsapp chat to his wife.

OCR technology has widespread usage across many areas. It **enables computers to understand pictures**. If computers understand what text is inside images, then users can search for specific terms across photos.

Scanned document is a just photo of the document - usually of higher quality
than photos taken with mobile phones for example. Described with informal
terms scanners are specialized devices for taking photos of the documents.

.. _ocrs:

OCRs or OCRed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OCRs - jargon term - a verb derived from noun :ref:`OCR <ocr>`. Expression *File X was OCRed* means that optical character recognition process was performed on file X. Similarly expression *It OCRs the documents* reads "it uses optical character recognition technology over the documents" with same meaning as "it extracts text from scanned documents"
