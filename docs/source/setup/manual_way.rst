Manual Way (Bare Metal)
*************************

If you follow this document and still have troubles, please open an
`issue on GitHub: <https://github.com/ciur/papermerge/issues>`_ so I can fill in
the gaps.

This guide is split into two parts: short one and very detailed one. 
:ref:`manual_way_short_version` is meant for people who are confortable with development tools
like Python, Django, pip, git or even gcc. In this case I will skip most of details
as they will sound boring for such persons.

:ref:`manual_way_detailed_version` is for people who probably heard of Python - as programming
language - but do not have any experience working with it. Any form of prior
programming (in ruby, perl, java, C/C++) experience will help you to grasp the
concepts quicker.

In both versions of this guide you need to know what is a command line
terminal and how to work with it. In general Papermerge is a Linux/Unix based
software. In this guide I will use Ubuntu 20.04 as example, but this
instructions can be adopted easily for any Linux distribution.

.. _manual_way_short_version:

Short Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First :ref:`download` the sorce code. In this guide we clone latest stable version 1.4.0 into
folder PapermergeDMS (located in home folder)::

    $ git clone --branch v1.4.0 https://github.com/ciur/papermerge.git  PapermergeDMS


1. Install required Ubuntu 20.04 LTS deb packages::

    $ sudo apt install build-essential \
        python3-pip \
        python3-venv \
        git \
        imagemagick \
        poppler-utils \
        pdftk \
        tesseract-ocr \
        tesseract-ocr-eng \
        tesseract-ocr-deu \
        tesseract-ocr-fra \
        tesseract-ocr-spa


2. Create python virutal environment and activate it::

    $ cd ~/PapermergeDMS
    $ python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
    $ source .venv/bin/activate

Alternativelly you can create python virtual environment with command::

    $ virtualenv .venv -p python3.7

Advantage of last command is that you can specify exact python version.
Papermerge requires python version >= 3.7

3. Install necessary dependencies::

    $ pip3 install -r requirements/base.txt

4. Initialize SQLite database with::

    $ ./manage.py migrate

5. Create a user for Papermerge instance::

    $ ./manage.py createsuperuser

6. Start webserver with::

    $ ./manage.py runserver <IP>:<PORT>

If no specific IP or PORT is given, the default is 127.0.0.1:8000 also known
as http://localhost:8000/. 

7. In a separate window, change to the project's root directory again, but
this time, you should start the worker script with::

    $ ./manage.py worker

Detailed Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Step 1 - Python and Friends
#############################

Papermerge is written in Python. First thing you need to make sure python interpreter is installed.
Ubuntu 20.04 comes with python interpreter already installed. 
However, the command to invoke python interpreter is ``python3``::

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.8.2


.. note::
    
    Python community now transitions from python2 (which is not maintained
    anymore) to python3. This is why in many Linux distributions you can
    access python interpreter either with ``python`` command or with
    ``python3`` command. 

.. important::
        Make sure your python is at least version 3.7


A close python's friend is `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ command. `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ is python's package manager.
Similar as with python interpreter story - there might be either pip or ``pip3`` - latter is specifically for
python version 3. We will use pip3::

    $ sudo apt install python3-pip

Make sure it was installed::

    $ pip3 --version
    pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)


Another package which you need to install is ``python3-venv``. This one will be
used in Step 2  we'll learn and setup python virtual environment::


    $ sudo apt install python3-venv


Although Papermerge is written in python, it uses some *special*
python modules which are compiled from C sources and used in binary form. This
means that you need `gcc compiler <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ installed as well.

In Ubuntu 20.04, ``gcc`` is available via ``built-essential`` package::

    sudo apt install build-essential

Double check that ``gcc`` was installed::

    $ gcc --version
    gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-10ubuntu2) 9.3.0
    Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
    warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Ok, great! We have to install one more utility - ``git``. Strictly speaking,
you don't need ``git``, because you can :ref:`download` the tarball and unzip
(or untar or extract) sources. But let's stick with git::

    $ sudo apt install git

Double check that ``git`` was installed::

    $ git --version
    git version 2.25.1

And now clone the latest stable version of Papermerge directly from GitHub repository::

    $ git clone --branch v1.4.0 https://github.com/ciur/papermerge.git  PapermergeDMS

.. note::

    As of writing this - latest stable version of Papermerge is 1.4.0, thus the argument ``--branch``
    with respective version. Also, notice that repository was cloned inside folder named PapermergeDMS, you
    can choose whatever title for that folder suites you.

From now on, I will refer to PapermergeDMS folder as *project root* or *top
level folder of the project*

Step 2 - Python Virtual Environment
####################################

Change directory to project's root (folder where you cloned/extracted sources)::

    $ cd PapermergeDMS


Our goal in this step is to install python dependencies - like `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ for example. Most important dependencies -
without which project won't start - are listed in ``requirements/base.txt``
(relative to project's root).

The command to do that is as simple as ``pip install -r
requirements/base.txt`` - but please don't rush to type it yet. We need to
clarify the concept of python virtual environment first.

If you simply type ``pip insall -r requirements/base.txt`` - it will install
packages **system-wide**. A better approach is to install dependencies **per
project**. So, *the place* designated for python packages specific for this
project is called a *virtual environment*. Let's create a python virtual
environment and name it ``.venv``::

$ python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages


.. note::

    For virtual environment you can choose whatever name you want. For example
    you can choose to name your virtual environment py37, in that case command
    will be ``python3 -m venv py37``. However, I chose *.venv* because in
    Unix/Linux dotted folders have special meaning - they are hidden so to
    speak.

.. note::

    ``--system-site-packages`` is necessary, it will install a package called ``wheel``.
    Without ``wheel`` package, pip install later will issue warning.

Alternatively you can create python virtual environment with following command::

    $ virtualenv .venv -p python3.7

Advantage of last command is that it specifies exact python version.

.. note::
    Papermerge requires python version >= 3.7

Next we need to *activate* virtual environment::

$ source .venv/bin/activate

Terminal's prompt (bash - in Ubuntu) will change to indicate that python virtual environment is active.

.. figure:: ../img/setup/01-active-venv.png

.. note::

    Python virtual environment is just a directory where python packages will
    be installed. Activating python environment is basically changing your
    current ``PATH`` variable - this is exactly what ``source
    .venv/bin/activate`` command does. If you will run ``echo $PATH`` you will
    notice that ``PapermergeDMS/.venv/bin`` is first in path, this means that
    python interpreter first of all will look up for its dependencies there.

And now, with python virtual environment active, let's install Papermerge dependencies::

    $ source .venv/bin/activate # a reminder to run this first
    $ pip3 install -r requirements/base.txt

At this point, all python packages were installed inside directory
``.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages`` and that directory is first one in your
path.

Step 3 - Manage Command
#########################

Papermerge is based on `Django Web Framework <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_.
Django provides a ``manage.py`` script which is used to run all project related commands.
``manage.py`` script is located in project's root directory.

First let's run migrations::

    $ ./manage.py migrate

.. note::

    At this point you will see warnings about missing binary dependencies. We
    deal with them little bit later when we will discuss ``./manage.py check``
    command.

*run migrations* - in django's jargon means that you prepare the database. By
default Papermerge (as any Django based project) uses `sqlite
<https://sqlite.org/>`_ database - which is stored in a single file.
``./manage.py migrate`` command will create that file (it is called db.sqlite3
and is in project's root directory) and create database schema for the
project.

We are not ready yet, but at this point, you can built-in web server and
access login screen::

    $ ./manage.py runserver

``runserver`` command will start web server on port ``8000``. You
can access login screen via any web browser by pointing it to
``http://localhost:8000/``


.. figure:: ../img/setup/02-login-screen.png

But as I mentioned, we are not ready yet. First of all, when you run
``./manage.py runserver`` command you probably noticed couple of warnings. To see
if all binary dependencies were installed run following command::

$ ./manage.py check

On freshly installed Ubuntu 20.04 LTS you will see following warnings::

    System check identified some issues:

    WARNINGS:
    ?: Papermerge can't find convert. Without it, image resizing is not possible.
            HINT: Either it's not in your PATH or it's not installed.
    ?: Papermerge can't find identify. Without it, it is not possible to count pages in TIFF.
            HINT: Either it's not in your PATH or it's not installed.
    ?: Papermerge can't find pdftk. Without it, Papermerge won't be able to cut/paste PDF pages.
            HINT: Either it's not in your PATH or it's not installed.
    ?: Papermerge can't find tesseract. Without it, OCR of the documents is impossible.
            HINT: Either it's not in your PATH or it's not installed.
    ?: papermerge.conf.py file was found. Following locations attempted /etc/papermerge.conf.py, papermerge.conf.py
            HINT: Create one of those files or point PAPERMERGE_CONFIG environment name to it.

    System check identified 5 issues (0 silenced).

This means that you need to install all above dependencies. Let's install all
of them in one shot::


    sudo apt install imagemagick \
        poppler-utils \
        pdftk \
        tesseract-ocr \
        tesseract-ocr-eng \
        tesseract-ocr-deu \
        tesseract-ocr-fra \
        tesseract-ocr-spa

When installation is complete, run check again::

    $ ./manage.py check

    System check identified some issues:

    WARNINGS:
    ?: papermerge.conf.py file was found. Following locations attempted /etc/papermerge.conf.py, papermerge.conf.py
            HINT: Create one of those files or point PAPERMERGE_CONFIG environment name to it.

    System check identified 1 issue (0 silenced).

To silence last warning, just create an empty ``papermerge.conf.py`` file in project's root,
we will turn our attention to that file little bit later::

    $ touch papermerge.conf.py


Step 4 - Superuser
####################


It's time to create administrative (superuser) user for your Papermerge instance::

$ ./manage.py createsuperuser

The username and password you will type above you will use as login credentials.
So, start server again (in case it is not running)::

$ ./manage.py runserver

Point your web browser to ``http://localhost:8000`` and use superuser's
username/password to login.


Step 5 - Worker
#################

In a separate window, change to the project's root directory again, but this
time, you should start the worker with ``./manage.py worker``.
Remember to activate python virtual environment first::

    $ cd ~/PapermergeDMS
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ ./manage worker

Worker is the part which performs :ref:`ocr` process. For correct function of Papermerge you must have both parts
running:

    * main app - the one which you start with ``./manage.py runserver``
    * worker - the one which you start with ``./manage.py worker``

Now, you can start uploading documents. Remember that only PDF, TIFF, jpeg and
png :ref:`file_formats` are supported.

.. figure:: ../img/setup/03-main-browse-view.png


Step 6 - Configurations
#########################

By default, you don't need configuration ``papermerge.conf.py`` file.
However, if there is no configuration file - Papermerge will issue a warning.
In one of previous steps we created an empty configuration file::

    $ cd ~/PapermergeDMS
    $ touch papermerge.conf.py # it is empty now

.. note::

    **What is the purpose of empty configuration file?** It has one - it raises
    awareness of administrator that such file exists. The logic is following -
    if administrator created papermerge.conf.py => Papermerge application
    immediately concludes admin is aware of such file and silence the warning
    message. Again - it is absolutely OK to leave papermerge.conf.py file
    empty.


By default, in language dropdown menu, two languages will be displayed German and English.
You can change that with following configuration::

    OCR_LANGUAGES = {
        'eng': 'English',
        'deu': 'Deutsch',
        'spa': 'Español',
        'fra': 'Français'
    }

Now four languages will be displayed in language dropdown.

    .. note::
        In previous steps we installed english, spanish, french and german tesseract language
        packs (packages named tesseract-ocr-eng, tesseract-ocr-deu, tesseract-ocr-fra, tesseract-ocr-spa).
        For each language you want to :ref:`ocr` you need to have tesseract language pack installed.

What's Next?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you’ve tested things and are happy with the work flow, you should secure
the installation and automate the process of starting the webserver and
worker. :ref:`server_configurations` explains different configuration
scenarios of how you can make your bare metal setup - more stable.
