Server Configurations
**********************

The default is to use Django’s development server provided by ``./manage.py runserver``
command, as that’s easy and does the job well enough on a home network.
However it is heavily discouraged to use it for more than that.

If you want to do things right you should use a real webserver capable of
handling more than one thread. You will also have to let the webserver serve
the static files (CSS, JavaScript) from the directory configured in
:ref:`static_dir`. The default static files directory is ``static``.

For that you need to activate your virtual environment and collect the static
files with the command::

    $ ./manage.py collectstatic

Setting up a web server can sound daunting for folks who don't normally do
that kind of thing. This guide will help you walk through the configuration
for Apache or Nginx on Linux and OSX.

.. note::
    If this all looks too overwhelming for you, we do offer `affordable hosted
    solutions <https://papermerge.com/pricing>`_ for folks who want to use
    Papermerge but don't know how to run a web server, or don't have time to keep
    up with updates.


Apache
~~~~~~~~

The most common setup for Papermerge on a linux server is to use Apache, so if
you're not sure what to pick, Apache might be the best bet, as it's free, easy
to configure, and well documented.

In order use apache web server with Django (web framework used by Papermerge)
you need to install so called module `mod_wsgi
<https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html>`_

Step 1 - Install Apache Web Server
####################################

On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS you install apache web server with following command::

    $ sudo apt install apache2

Step 2 - Get mod_wsgi
########################

Get latest release of `mod_wsgi from here <https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/releases>`_. Extract archive::

    unzip mod_wsgi-4.7.1
    cd mod_wsgi-4.7.1

Step 3 - Build & Install mod_wsgi
###################################

In order to build mod_wsgi on Ubuntu Linux, you need three things:
    
        * ``build-essential`` ubuntu package with gcc compiler and friends
        * ``apache2-dev`` package
        * ``python interpreter`` from your **papermerge virtual environment**

Let's first install required packages::

$ sudo apt install build-essential apache2-dev

Next, activate your Papermerge virtual environment (python virtual environment)::

$ source /opt/papermerge/.venv/bin/activate

.. warning::

    Activating python virtual environment is very important step. Because when
    compilying mod_wsgi it must find in $PATH **python interpreter** located
    in same virtual environment with other python dependencies.
    
Switch to extracted directory mod_wsgi-4.7.1 and run following commands::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ``sudo make install`` command will copy ``mod_wsgi.so``
binary file to ``/usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_wsgi.so``

Next enable mod_wsgi module with following command::

    $ a2enmod mod_wsgi

You can double check if mod_wsgi module was enabled with::

    $ apachectl -M

It should display a list enabled modules. Among other should be::

    ...
    wsgi_module (shared)  
    ...


Step 4 - Configure Virtual Host
################################

In directory ``/etc/apache2/sites-available`` create a virtual configuration file for papermerge. 
Let's say papermerge.site. Here is configuration example for virtual host::


    <VirtualHost *:8060>
        <Directory /opt/papermerge/config>
            Require all granted
        </Directory>

        Alias /static/ /var/static/papermerge/

        <Directory /var/startic/papermerge>
          Require all granted
        </Directory>

        ServerName papermerge.home
        ServerRoot /opt/papermerge
    </VirtualHost>

    WSGIPythonHome /opt/papermerge/.venv/
    WSGIPythonPath /opt/papermerge/
    WSGIScriptAlias / /opt/papermerge/config/wsgi.py


The first bit in the WSGIScriptAlias line is the base URL path you want to
serve your application at (/ indicates the root url), and the second is the
location of a WSGI file, inside papermerge project as ``config/wsgi.py``. This
tells Apache to serve any request below the given URL using the WSGI
application defined in that file.

``WSGIPythonHome`` is path to python's virtual environment.

Nginx + Gunicorn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another way to deploy Papermerge behind a real web server is by using ``Nginx
+ Gunicorn`` duo. `Gunicorn <https://gunicorn.org/>`_ is called application server - it serves WSGI
(Papermerge/Django) application via HTTP protocol (in that sense Gunicorn is
kind of web server). However, gunicorn cannot serve static content
(JavaScript, CSS, images), this task falls on NginX shoulders.

Step 1 - Install Gunicorn
###########################

`Gunicorn <https://gunicorn.org/>`_ is not provided in list of dependencies. Thus, you need to installed in your current
virtual python environment::

    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install gunicorn

Create gunicorn configuration file::

    $ cat /opt/etc/gunicorn.conf.py

    workers = 2
    errorlog = "/opt/log/gunicorn.error"
    accesslog = "/opt/log/gunicorn.access"
    loglevel = "debug"

    bind = ["127.0.0.1:9001"]

.. note::
  
    Gunicorn configuration file must have .py extention and its syntax is
    valid python syntax.

.. important:: 
        
    Binding port is 9001. This same port will be later used to proxy http
    requests from nginx to gunicorn.

and environment variables file::

    $ cat /opt/etc/gunicorn.env

    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production

You need to create a production.py file in /opt/papermerge/config/setting/ directory.
Here is an example of production.py file content::

    $ cat /opt/papermerge/config/settings/production.py

    from .base import *  # noqa

    DEBUG = False
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']


Step 2 - Systemd Service for Gunicorn
#######################################

Example of systemd unit file for Gunicorn::

    [Unit]
    Description=Gunicorn Service

    [Service]
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/papermerge
    EnvironmentFile=/opt/etc/gunicorn.env
    ExecStart=/opt/papermerge/.venv/bin/gunicorn config.wsgi:application --config /opt/etc/gunicorn.conf.py
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target


Step 3 - Nginx
################

And finally connect nginx with gunicorn. Here is a sample configuration for nginx::

    server {
        server_name papermerge.home;
        listen 9000;

        location /static/ {
            alias /opt/static/;
        }

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9001;
        }
    }


Worker
~~~~~~~~
Here is worker.service unit::

    [Unit]
    Description=Papermerge Worker
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/papermerge
    ExecStart=/opt/papermerge/.venv/bin/python /opt/papermerge/manage.py worker --pidfile /tmp/worker.pid
    Restart=on-failure

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

.. note::

    Notice that ``ExecStart`` is **absolute path to python interpreter inside
    python virtual environment**. Absolute path to python interpreter inside
    virtual environment is enough information for python to figure out the
    rest of python dependencies from the same virtual environment. Thus, you
    don't need to provide futher information about virtual environment.

Systemd .service may be placed in one of several locations. One options is
to place it in ``/etc/systemd/system`` together with other system level
units. In this case you need root access permissions.

Another option is to place .service file inside ``$HOME/.config/systemd/user/``
In this case you can start/check status/stop systemd unit service with following commands::

    systemctl --user start worker
    systemctl --user status worker
    systemctl --user stop worker


.. _broker_config:

Broker, Messaging Queue and their Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Web application (a.k.a. main app) shows users fancy UI and is basically what
end users see and interact with. Worker extracts information from scanned
documents (:ref:`OCRs <ocr>` them) i.e workers actually do the most laborious
task. Number of workers is only limited by your resources: there can be one 
worker or one thousand.

How does web application pass the heavy OCR jobs to the worker(s)? How does it
happen that in case of many workers one starts the job and others are aware of
it and do not start the same again - i.e. a job is never performed twice? All
this *workers management* is done by a component called *Broker*. Passing of
those OCR related jobs from main app to the broker (which in turn will pass it to correct
worker) is done via so called *Messaging Queue*. Messaging queue can be
something as simple as file system; but database, computer memory, key/value
in-memory databases are also good candidates.

The thing is, to keep initial setup very simple (i.e. to require the minimum
amount of configuration to start the application) the broker part is performed
by a package called celery - which is part of Papermerge. Similarly, to keep
everything simple at the beginning message queue was chosen to be file system
itself.

By default, configurations for broker and messaging queue are
following::

    CELERY_BROKER_URL = "filesystem://"
    CELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS = {
        'data_folder_in': PAPERMERGE_TASK_QUEUE_DIR,
        'data_folder_out': PAPERMERGE_TASK_QUEUE_DIR,
    }

Where ``PAPERMERGE_TASK_QUEUE_DIR`` points to the folder on the file system,
and its default value is ``queue``. Which basically means that all messages
will be saved in the current folder named ``queue``.

Above configuration is fantastic for development, because zero configuration required.

However, **filesystem based broker configuration is terrible for production!**

If you will use it, you will experience CPU increase over time, like described
in this `ticket <https://github.com/ciur/papermerge/issues/198>`_ on github. 

Following is good configuration for production::

    CELERY_BROKER_URL = "redis://"
    CELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS = {}
    CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = "redis://localhost/0"

It uses `redis <https://redis.io/>`_ key value database. With redis as broker transport you will
never have CPU spikes.

.. important::

    ``CELERY_BROKER_URL``, ``CELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS`` and
    ``CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`` configurations go into django configuration file
    of Papermerge project not in papermerge.conf.py. Django configuration file
    is the one in <project_dir>/`config/base.py
    <https://github.com/ciur/papermerge/blob/master/config/settings/base.py>`_
